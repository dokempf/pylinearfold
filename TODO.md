The following tasks need to be done to get a fully working project:

* Set up a remote repository. You can e.g. create a project in GitHub or GitLab and run
  the following commands in your locally generated project folder: `git remote add origin <Remote-URL>`
  For a seamless integration, the name of the project should also be `pylinearfold`.
* Make sure that the following software is installed on your computer:
  * A C++-11-compliant C++ compiler
  * CMake `>= 3.9`
* Edit the parameters of `pyproject.toml` file to contain the necessary information
  about your project, such as your email adress, PyPI classifiers and a short project description.
* Head to your user settings at `https://pypi.org` and `https://test.pypi.org/` to setup PyPI trusted publishing.
  In order to do so, you have to head to the "Publishing" tab, scroll to the bottom
  and add a "new pending publisher". The relevant information is:
  * PyPI project name: `pylinearfold`
  * Owner: `None`
  * Repository name: `None`
  * Workflow name: `pypi.yml`
  * Environment name: not required
