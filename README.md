# Welcome to pylinearfold

[![PyPI Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pylinearfold.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pylinearfold)

This project provides Python bindings to both [LinearFold](https://github.com/LinearFold/LinearFold) and [LinearPartition](https://github.com/LinearFold/LinearPartition) from one Python package. The package can be installed from
PyPI as wheels - not requiring any C++ compiler toolchain at the end user.

# Installation

Installing `pylinearfold` should be done directly from PyPI:

```python
python -m pip install pylinearfold
```

# License

Please review the licensing terms in LICENSE.md. We provide these bindings under
the same license as the original code.
